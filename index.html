    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Travis Duplantis. I'm a new student, starting at the Skill Distillery coding bootcamp on September 9, 2019.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this blog is to share my journey through all that I'll learn this semester.</p>
    <p>I've also shared a little about who I am personally, along with my professional and other educational experiences.</p>
    <p>As the Skill Distillery course progresses I hope to share the projects I've worked on, in order to build a portfolio showcasing my abilites for future employers</p>
    <p>I'll also be sharing any helpful resources I come across during the course of my education and career that follows</p>

    <!--
    MY TOP BLOG IDEAS 
    *What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery? How are you going to achieve it? What is your big 'why'?

    *When you get frustrated and discouraged what do you do? How can you keep your confidence up and encourage yourself during the program? (Add Skill Distillery Scholarship essay??)

    OTHER IDEAS
    What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?

    When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.

    To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized (you may need to investigate Static classes...hint hint).

    What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.

    What is the difference between ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loops? Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’?

    What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?

    What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?

    When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?

    What experience do you have coding? What have you created already? What do you want to create during/after the program?
