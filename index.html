    <h3>Travis Duplantis</h3>
    <p>I'm a new student, attending the Skill Distillery coding bootcamp from September 9, 2019 through January 10, 2019.</p>
    <button class = "button" onclick="window.location.href='about.html'">Learn About Me</button>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this blog is to share my journey through all that I'll learn during this course.</p>
    <p>I'll also share a little about who I am personally, along with my professional and other educational experiences.</p>
    <p>As the Skill Distillery course progresses, I hope to share the projects I'll work on, in order to build a portfolio showcasing my abilites for future employers.</p>
    <p>I'll also be sharing any helpful resources I come across during the course of my education and (hopefully very fruitful) career that follows.</p>

    MY TOP BLOG IDEAS
    What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.

    What is the difference between ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loops? Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’?

    What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?

    When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?
